\section{Access Control Module}

\subsection{Problem Summary}

\hspace{0.35cm} Currently, the complete content offered in the courses on Bodhitree can be accessed by any student who is registered for the course. If a student has access to a course, the he has access to all the videos, documents, quizzes and assignments in that course.
\par There might be a case where the instructor wants to limit the access of content to the students. He might want some students to not have access to a particular content type, for example, the instructor would want only those students to have access to the in-video quizzes who have made some payment.
\par The access control module enables the instructor to provide differential access to students based upon the access that he grants them.
